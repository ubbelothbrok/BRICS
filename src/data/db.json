Using advanced Computer Vision and gesture recognition, we've created a system where your hand movements in the real world control virtual building blocks on a massive screen.\n\nThe objective? Build the tallest, most stable tower possible within a time limit. You simply wave your hands to pick up blocks, rotate them, and stack them. The physics engine simulates gravity and balance in real-time, so one wrong move and your virtual tower comes crumbling down! It's a fun, gamified way to understand the power of Augmented Reality.",
