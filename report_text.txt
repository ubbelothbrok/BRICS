Reimagining Indian Schools

Principal’s Conclave
Under Pragyaan Event by IIT Jammu

1

Executive Summary

The Indian school education system stands at a pivotal moment. While the National
Education Policy (NEP) 2020 offers a transformative vision, the ground reality faces
significant hurdles ranging from foundational infrastructure deficits to a lack of futureready pedagogical skills. Pragyaan is proposed as a high-intensity ”Working Conclave”
designed to bridge this gap. Unlike traditional ceremonial events, Pragyaan will bring
together school principals, senior policymakers, higher education leaders (IITs), and industry veterans onto a single platform. The primary objective is to move beyond theoretical debates and draft the ”Pragyaan Charter”—a concrete, actionable roadmap
for infrastructure standards, digital equity, and skills integration by 2030.

Strategic Context

India faces a ”dual challenge” that requires immediate, synchronized action. First, there
is the struggle with the basics: crumbling infrastructure, lack of amenities in border and
remote areas, and a widening post-pandemic digital divide. Second, there represents the
challenge of aspiration: a rapidly evolving global economy demanding competencies in
AI, robotics, and critical thinking that our current syllabus-heavy model struggles to
deliver.
The necessity for this conclave arises from the disconnect between the four critical
stakeholders of education: the Schools trying to execute reforms, the Policymakers
designing them, the Higher Education Institutions (like IIT Jammu) that understand
systems thinking, and the Industry that eventually employs these students. Pragyaan
aims to replace these silos with a unified dialogue.

Thematic Agenda

The conclave will be structured around two critical themes, each addressed through focused, problem-solving discussions.

3.1

Theme 1: Infrastructure, Equity & Access

This session addresses the physical and digital foundations of schooling. It is not merely
a question of constructing walls, but of ensuring dignity and access. The dialogue will
focus on defining minimum viable infrastructure standards for 2030 and addressing the
stark disparities between urban centers and remote border regions. Key areas of focus
include leveraging Samagra Shiksha for holistic infrastructure support, sustainable
maintenance models involving CSR and Public-Private Partnerships, residential solutions
for remote areas, and ensuring safety and sanitation for girls. The goal is to develop a
”Comprehensive School Readiness Framework” that ensures no child is left behind due
to geography or lack of resources.

3.2

Theme 2: Future-Ready Learning & Innovation

Moving beyond infrastructure, this theme tackles the ”software” of education: pedagogy
and skills. While the NEP 2020 promotes competency-based learning, schools often find
themselves trapped in a cycle of rote compliance. This session will bring together regulatory bodies (NCERT/CBSE) and deep-tech industry leaders to map out how STEM,
AI, and robotics can be integrated into the daily curriculum—transforming Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs) from static investments into vibrant innovation hubs. A crucial
component will be teacher capability; we must outline strategies for upskilling educators
without leading to burnout. PM SHRI schools will play a pivotal role here, serving
as ”lighthouse” institutions that demonstrate these future-ready pedagogies to the wider
network.

Digital Strategy

To demonstrate the conclave’s commitment to modernization, the event will be powered
by the Pragyaan Digital Platform. Prior to the event, participating principals will
submit a digital facilities audit, providing real-time data on the state of labs and internet
connectivity to inform the panels. During the event, the platform will facilitate a dynamic
Q&A system where audience questions are filtered and displayed live to moderators.
Real-time polling will also be used to gauge the room’s sentiment on key policy debates
instantly.

4.3

Stakeholders

The event will host a curated list of high-impact attendees. The Opening Plenary
involves leadership from IIT Jammu and the Ministry of Education. The Panels will
feature a diverse mix: Education Secretaries and Central Government representatives for
policy insights; Industry leaders from companies like Airtel and L&T for CSR and technical perspectives; and crucially, School Principals—both from successful model schools
(PM SHRI/KV) and from challenging border regions.

Organizational & Financial Overview

5.1

Team Structure

The execution will be led by an Overall Management Head, supported by three vertical
teams. The Event Execution team handles the live flow, including moderators and
stream management. The Content & Strategy team is responsible for the research
behind the charter and the digital platform. Finally, the Logistics team ensures seamless
on-ground operations.

Financial Estimates

The estimated budget for the event is INR 2,00,000. This covers lunch for 200 attendees
(INR 60,000), refreshments for the extended sessions (INR 40,000), and souvenirs/gifts
for speakers and guests (INR 51,000), with a dedicated contingency fund (INR 49,000)
to manage unforeseen expenses.

Conclusion

Pragyaan represents more than just a gathering of experts; it is a decisive step towards
operationalizing the vision of a Developed India (Viksit Bharat) by 2047. By addressing
the foundational deficits of today while simultaneously building the capacity for the
future, the conclave aims to create a replicable model for school transformation. With
the collective will of policymakers, the technical expertise of IIT Jammu, and the practical
experience of school principals, the ”Pragyaan Charter” will serve as the North Star
for Indian schools in the decade to come. We seek your approval and support to turn
this vision into reality.
