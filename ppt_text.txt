The Context: Why We Are Here

Why This Event? (The Urgency)

What is Pragyaan? (The Action)

The Gap: Crumbling infrastructure vs.
Future aspirations.

Not a Ceremony: Zero formalities,
100% problem-solving.

The Reality: NEP 2020 is visionary, but
execution is stuck between compliance
and ground reality.

A Working Conclave: Bringing
Principals, Policymakers, and
Industry into one room.

The Need: Bridging the disconnect
between Schools, Policymakers, Higher Ed
(IIT), and Industry.

The Output: A ”Charter” for
Indian Schools – an actionable
roadmap, not just talk.
